# platrant
Platrant is an unofficial community driven platformer game based around the popular [devRant app].(http://devrant.io)
This project spawned from the frustration of needing experience to get into the game development scene,
but nowhere to get said experience. This led to a post on devrant.io, which led to an open project where
developers can learn game development! The idea is to learn, make, ship and brag!
